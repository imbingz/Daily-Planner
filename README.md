### 1. Project Context - User Story
* Use of a daily planner can help us, especially the ones with a busy schedule, better manage out time and accomplish greater results in lesser amounts of time.
* When users open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar with timeblocks for standard business hours as users scroll down
* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 
* Users can enter an even and save the event via a button for that timeblock in local storage as long as they wish.

### 2. Project Objectives
* Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.
* This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
* It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.(I used the given HTML & CSS files with minimal custom styling)

* The user interface is responsive to different devices - mobile, tablets, laptops and larger screen desktops
* The app dynamically takes in user input and store the day plan in the localStorage and display in the textarea
